**Refining a Theory of Neighborhood Change**

The federal programs under consideration are one of many programs that consist of "aid" or "assistance" dollars being sent to vulnerable communities to catalyze some sort of change. 

One of my favorite data viz fails is this tone-def visualization of World Bank contracts presented by adapting what appears to be a World War III missile attack simulation. Development aid is launched from the donor country and explodes as it hits the recipient country:

The metaphor is perfect for todays discussion topic because the science of economic development is still in the leaches phase and many argue that some policies do more harm than good. 

> It is important to identify clear goals or outcomes for these programs in order to build a theory of change around the intended impact and start to operationalize measures for outcomes. 


**Lack of Data**

These above issues are raised not to argue that place-based initiatives are not effective or pro-poor policies are not helpful. Rather, it is to highlight the challenges of place-based economic development policy:

* We measure success of programs by the value locked in a neighborhood - mainly houses, household income, and schools. 
* Census data does not tell us whether rises in value are a result of infill development which diversifies a neighborhood economically and benefits current residents, or by displacing poor people and replacing them with wealthier residents. 

The challenge is that we do not have the appropriate data to really study this question. In the paper, “Designing Policies to Spur Economic Growth: How Regional Scientists Can Contribute to Future Policy Development and Evaluation” the authors make the argument that to improve policy-making we need to improve data because we currently cannot effectively measure the “treatment” in economic development - all of the investments and subsidies that occur within a tract (think of the missile launch visualization with aid coming from federal sources, state sources, and metro sources and flowing to specific census tracts), and using home value and income as outcome variables in these studies make it hard to tell which mechanism - growth or displacement - is driving the result. 

In a couple of weeks you will begin to look at data on the effectiveness of tax credit programs on catalyzing economic development. These programs were selected partly because they are some of the only large-scale federal programs that have made their data available and easy to access. 

The lack of data on this topic is a huge gap in the open data landscape. Only recently have serious attempts been made to measure the extent of these credits, and mostly by people outside of government, the most notable example being the [Panel Database on Incentives and Taxes](https://www.upjohn.org/research-highlights/new-database-and-report-reveal-how-much-states-spend-incentives-entice-businesses). But without good data on all government and private investments flowing into census tracts we are likely to produce biased evaluations of policy effectiveness. 

**Prediction vs Causality**

If you are not feeling well the doctor might take a blood sample to test for cancer. They are looking for elevated levels of white blood counts and various protein markers. If present the doctor can detect cancer early and have a better chance of treating it effectively. 

Blood markers predict cancer. They do not cause it. Doctors almost never actually know the cause of a specific case of cancer, but they know from drug trials which medicines work for treating it.

Similarly, it is much easier to predict which census tracts are likely to improve over time than it is to explain the underlying causes. In policy we care about causality because we want to know if we implement a specific expensive revitalization policy it will create the intended changes. But prediction is also useful for planning and responsible governance of the process of change. 

As we move past descriptive analysis and into inferential models try to keep the two ideas distinct in your mind. Some of the census variables will help us predict which neighborhoods are likely to change over the next decade. But many of these are like blood markers - they provide information that can be used for prediction but don't necessarily explain the mechanisms. 

Our interest in tax credits, however, is causal. Saying that a model offers an unbiased estimate of program impact is the same thing as saying we have cleanly identified a causal mechanism. If you filter out white blood cells from a persons body you do not remove the cancer because the mechanism is not causal. If you increase dollars spent on revitalization in a neighborhood will you actually see more development occur? 

Take caution when interpretting variables that might be markers so that you do not make the mistake of saying things like immigrants drive down home prices and school performance. The actual mechanism is more likely immigrants are located in declining neighborhoods because it's where the cheapest housing is, but without immigrants the neighborhood would decline even faster. Correlation is not causation. Check your assumptions. 

More importantly, try to think about the requirements necessary to make the claim that economic development programs cause neighborhood change. There is a big selection problem here - tax credit programs are implemented by bankers and developers. This is prudent design because they have a vested interest in the tax credits working since investments in communities where they don't will create a loss for them. It limits wasteful spending on neighborhoods where the programs have no chance of success. On the other hand the program dollars are more likely to flow to neighborhoods that are most likely to experience growth since those are communities where return on investment is highest. As a result many resources are spent in communities where development would have occurred without the program. In this case the programs are not creating community change, and since they are likely flowing to communities that are expected to improve anyhow they are only effective if they create **more** change than we would have experienced without them. The counterfactual is really important in this context!

If a community is on the up-swing it will attract tax credit dollars, but it will also attract a lot of other types of investment. We can only cleanly identify the impact of tax credits if we can control for all other types of investment. Therein lies the rub.

**Reflection** 

If you could get data on any capital expenditure or economic transfer that landed in a census tract, what data would you want to include in the model? 

Are there place-based investments like infrastructure or schools that you think would matter? Programs that target the type of residents that live in the community? 

Private investments like new businesses (Starbucks and Whole Foods) or improvements to current housing stock. 

Parks? Bike paths? Recreation facilities? 

Assuming data is no issue, what sorts of investments would you want to include in your model as a control variable?
